# ToDoish

I have developed a simple to-do application in Javascript using React Native API.

### Features:

- Add tasks
- Remove tasks

Since I have used some icons for this app I would like to attribute their creators for their effort to make them. Therefore here are the links for all the icons:

- <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/gym" title="gym icons">Gym icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>
- <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/fast" title="fast icons">Fast icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>
- <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/bike" title="bike icons">Bike icons created by Google - Flaticon</a>
